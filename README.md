As you can see, your brand new fish tank is empty. The good news is, you can buy some fish to bring life to this eco-system. Create a soothing and relaxing pixel art ecosystem. Simply enjoy.

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, you will need to compile and run the project yourself to play.

>#### 📜 Tutorial
>
>1. Ensure you have Java installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from [Java's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
>2. Navigate to the project's root directory in the command line or terminal.
>3. Compile the project. there are a lot of files so just "javac AquariumApp" doesn't work
>4. Once compiled, run the project using the command:
>```bash
>java -cp ./src AquariumApp
>```
>5. The game should now start, and you can enjoy your pixel-art aquatic ecosystem!

Here's a list of the different species 🐠:

- Casual fish
- Shark 🦈
- Tetras 
- Puffer fish 🐡
- Jelly fish 🌊

> 💡 *They are all free (yes, haven't coded a payment method...) so go ahead and see how they interact with their environment.*

## 📖 Simple Menu

The main menu allows you to choose from the following actions:

1. "Follow me" - all the fish will now hunt the cursor 🎯.
2. "Light" - You can turn the light on and off 💡.
3. "Pixel art" - Toggle the pixel art effect on the fishes 🎨.
